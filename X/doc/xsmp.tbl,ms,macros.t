This document specifies a protocol that facilitates the management of groups
of client applications by a session manager.  The session manager can cause
clients to save their state, to shut down, and to be restarted into a
previously saved state.  This protocol is layered on top of the X
Consortium's ICE protocol.

.nH 1 "Definitions and Goals"
.LP
The purpose of the X Session Management Protocol (XSMP) is to provide a
uniform mechanism for users to save and restore their sessions.  A
\fIsession\fP is a group of clients, each of which has a particular state.
The session is controlled by a network service called the \fIsession
manager\fP\^.  The session manager issues commands to its clients on behalf
of the user.  These commands may cause clients to save their state or to
terminate.  It is expected that the client will save its state in such a
way that the client can be restarted at a later time and resume its
operation as if it had never been terminated.  A client's state might
include information about the file currently being edited, the current
position of the insertion point within the file, or the start of an 
uncommitted transaction.
The means by which clients are
restarted is unspecified by this protocol.
.LP
For purposes of this protocol, a \fIclient\fP of the session manager is
defined as a connection to the session manager.  A client is typically,
though not necessarily, a process running an application program connected
to an X window system display.  However, a client may be connected to more
than one X display or not be connected to any X displays at all.
.LP
This protocol is layered on top of the X Consortium's ICE protocol, and relies on
the ICE protocol to handle connection management and authentication.
.LP
.nH 1 "Overview of the Protocol"
.LP
Clients use XSMP to register themselves with the session manager (SM).  When
a client starts up, it should connect to the SM.  The client should remain
connected for as long as it runs.  A client may resign from the session by
issuing the proper protocol messages before disconnecting.  Termination of
the connection without notice will be taken as an indication that the client
died unexpectedly.
.LP
Clients are expected to save their state in such a way as to allow multiple
instantiations of themselves to be managed independently.  A unique value
called a \fIclient-ID\fP is provided by the protocol for the purpose of
disambiguating multiple instantiations of clients.  Clients may use this ID,
for example, as part of a filename in which to store the state for a
particular instantiation.  The client-ID should be saved as part of the
command used to restart this client (the \fIRestartCommand\fP\^) so that the
client will retain the same ID after it is restarted.  Certain small pieces
of state might also be stored in the RestartCommand.   For example, an X11 client
might place a `\-twoWindow' option in its RestartCommand to indicate that it
should start up in two window mode when it is restarted.
.LP
The client finds the network address of the SM in a system-dependent way.
On POSIX systems an environment variable called SESSION_MANAGER will contain
a list of network IDs. Each id will contain the transport name followed by a 
slash and the (transport-specific)
address.  A TCP/IP address would look like this:
.ID
	\f7tcp/\fP\fIhostname\fP\^\f7:\fP\^\fIportnumber\fP
.DE
where the hostname is a fully qualified domain name.
A Unix Domain address looks like this:
.ID
	\f7local/\fP\fIhostname\fP\^\f7:\fP\^\fIpath\fP
.DE
A DECnet address would look like this:
.ID
	\f7decnet/\fP\fInodename\fP\^\f7::sm$\fP\^\fIobjname\fP
.DE
If multiple network IDs are specified, they should be separated by commas.
.NT Rationale
There was much discussion over whether the XSMP protocol should use X as
the transport protocol or whether it should use its own independent
transport.  It was decided that it would use an independent protocol for
several reasons.  First, the Session Manager should be able to 
manage programs that
don't maintain an X connection.  Second, the X protocol is not appropriate to
use as a general-purpose transport protocol.  Third, a session might
span multiple displays.
.LP
The protocol is connection based, because there is no other way for the SM
to determine reliably when clients terminate.
.LP
It should be noted that this protocol introduces another single point of 
failure into the system.  Although it is possible for clients to continue 
running after the SM has exited, this will probably not be the case in 
normal practice. Normally the program that starts the SM will consider the
session to be terminated when the SM exits (either normally or abnormally).
.LP
To get around this would require some sort of 
rendezvous server that would also introduce a single point of failure.  In the
absence of a generally available rendezvous server, XSMP is kept simple in
the hopes of making simple reliable SMs.
.NE
.LP
Some clients may wish to manage the programs they start.  For example, a
mail program could start a text editor for editing the text of a mail
message.  A client that does this is a session manager itself;
it should supply the clients it starts with the appropriate connection
information (i.e. the SESSION_MANAGER environment variable) that specifies
a connection to itself instead of to the \*Qreal\*U session manager.
.LP
Each client has associated with it a list of properties. 
A property set by one client is not visible to any other client.
These properties are used for the client to inform the SM of the client's
current state.
When a client initially connects to the SM, there are no properties set.
.nH 1 "Data Types"
.LP
XSMP messages contain several types of data.  Both the SM and the client
always send messages in their native byte order.  Thus, both sides may need
to byte-swap the messages received.  The need to do byte-swapping is
determined at run-time by the ICE protocol. 
.LP
If an invalid value is specified for a field of any of the enumerated types, a
.PN BadValue
error message must be sent by the receiver of the message to the sender of the
message.

.nH 1 "Protocol Setup and Message Format"
.LP
To start the XSMP protocol, the client sends the server an ICE
.PN ProtocolSetup
message.  The protocol-name field should be specified as \*QXSMP\*U, the major
version of the protocol should be one, and the minor version should be zero.
These values may change if the protocol is revised.  The minor version
number will be incremented if the change is compatible, otherwise the major
version number will be incremented.
.LP
All XSMP messages are in the standard ICE message format.  The message's major
opcode is assigned to XSMP by ICE at run-time.  The different parties
(client and SM) may be assigned different major opcodes for XSMP.  Once
assigned, all XSMP messages issued by this party will use the same major
opcode.  The message's minor opcode specifies which protocol message this
message contains. 
.nH 1 "Client Identification String"
.LP
A client ID is a string of XPCS characters encoded in ISO Latin 1 (ISO
8859-1).  No null characters are allowed in this string.  The client ID
string is used in the
.PN Register\%Client
and
.PN Register\%ClientReply
messages.
.LP
Client IDs consist of the pieces described below.  The ID is
formed by concatenating the pieces in sequence, without
separator characters.  All pieces are zero-padded on the left
so as to fill the specified length.
Decimal numbers are
encoded using the characters `0' through `9', and
hexadecimal numbers using the characters `0' through `9'
and `A' through `F'.
.LP
Client IDs consist of the pieces described below.  The ID is formed by
concatenating the pieces in sequence, without separator characters.
.IP \(bu 4
Version.  This is currently the character `1'.
.IP \(bu 4
Address type and address.  The address type will be one of
.DS
.ta 0.5i
`1'	a 4-byte IP address encoded as 8 hexadecimal digits
`2'	a 6-byte DECNET address encoded as 12 hexadecimal digits
.DE
.IP
The address is the one of the network addresses of the machine where the
session manager (not the client) is running.  For example, the IP address
198.112.45.11 would be encoded as the string \*Q1C6702D0B\*U.
.IP \(bu 4
Time stamp.  A 13-digit decimal number specifying the number of
milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
.IP \(bu 4
Process-ID type and process-ID.  The process-ID type will be one of
.DS
.ta 0.5i
`1'	a POSIX process-ID encoded as a 10-digit decimal number.
.DE
.IP
The process-ID is the process-ID of the session manager, not of a client.
.IP \(bu 4
Sequence number.  This is a four-digit decimal number.  It is incremented
every time the session manager creates an ID.  After reaching \*Q9999\*U it
should wrap to \*Q0000\*U.
.NT "Rationale"
Once a client ID has been assigned to the client, the client keeps
this ID indefinitely.  If the client is terminated and restarted, it
will be reassigned the same ID.  It is desirable to be able to pass
client IDs around from machine to machine, from user to user, and
from session manager to session manager, while retaining the
identity of the client.  This, combined with the indefinite
persistence of client IDs, means that client IDs need to be globally
unique.  The construction specified above will ensure that any
client ID created by any user, session manager, and machine will be
different from any other.
.NE
.nH 1 "Protocol"
.LP
The protocol consists of a sequence of messages as described below.  Each
message type is specified by an ICE minor opcode.  A given message type is
sent either from a client to the session manager or from the session manager
to a client; the appropriate direction is listed with each message's
description.  For each message type, the set of 
valid responses and possible error
messages are listed.  The ICE severity is given in parentheses following
each error class.

The client must send this message to the SM to register the client's existence.
If a client is being restarted from a previous
session, the previous-ID field must contain the client ID from the
previous session.  
For new clients, previous-ID should be of zero length.
.LP
If previous-ID is not valid, the SM will send a
.PN BadValue
error message to the client.
At this point the SM reverts to the register state and waits for another
.PN RegisterClient .
The client should then send a

.LP
If the client didn't supply a client-ID field to the
.PN Register\%Client

and fast = False immediately after the
.PN RegisterClientReply .

.LP
The SM sends this message to a client to ask it to save
its state.  The client writes a state file, if necessary,
and, if necessary, uses 
.PN SetProperties
to inform the SM of
how to restart it and how to discard the saved state.  During
this process it can, if allowed by interact-style, request
permission to interact with the user by sending an
.PN InteractRequest .
After the state has been saved, or
if it cannot be successfully saved, and the properties
are appropriately set, the client sends a 
.PN SaveYourselfDone
message.  If shutdown is true, the client must then
freeze interaction with the user and wait until it
receives either a 
.PN Die or a 
.PN ShutdownCancelled
message.
.LP
If interact-style is
.PN None ,
the client must not interact with the
user while saving state.  If the interact-style is 
.PN Error ,
the client
may interact with the user only if an error condition arises.  If
interact-style is 
.PN Any ,
then the client may interact with the user for
any purpose.
This is done by sending an
.PN Interact\%Request
message.  The SM will send an
.PN Interact
message to
each client that sent an
.PN Interact\%Request .  
The client must postpone all
interaction until it gets the
.PN Interact
message.  When the client is done
interacting it should send the SM an
.PN Interact\%Done
message. The 
.PN Interact\%Request
message can be sent any time after a
.PN Save\%Yourself
and before a 
.PN Save\%Yourself\%Done .
.LP
Unusual circumstances may dictate multiple interactions.
The client may initiate as many
.PN Interact\%Request
\-
.PN Interact
\-
.PN InteractDone
sequences as it needs before it sends
.PN SaveYourselfDone .
.LP
When a client receives
.PN Save\%Yourself
and has not yet responded
.PN Save\%Yourself\%Done
to a previous
.PN Save\%Yourself ,
it must send a
.PN Save\%Yourself\%Done
and may then begin responding as appropriate
to the newly received 
.PN Save\%Yourself .
.LP
The type field specifies the type of information that should be saved:
.PN Global ,
.PN Local ,
or
.PN Both .
The 
.PN Local
type indicates that the application must update the
properties to reflect its current state, send a
.PN Save\%Yourself\%Done
and continue.  Specifically it should save enough information to restore
the state as seen by the user of this client.  It should not affect the
state as seen by other users.
The
.PN Global
type indicates that the user wants the client to 
commit all of its data to permanent, globally accessible
storage.
.PN Both
indicates that the client should do both of these.  If
.PN Both
is specified, the client should first commit the data to permanent storage
before updating its SM properties.
.NT Examples
If a word processor was sent a 
.PN SaveYourself
with a type of 
.PN Local ,
it could create a temporary file that included the
current contents of the file, the location of the cursor, and
other aspects of the current editing session. 
It would then update its
.PN Restart\%Command
property with enough information to find the temporary file, 
and its 
.PN Discard\%Command 
with enough information to remove it.
.LP
If a word processor was sent a 
.PN SaveYourself
with a type of
.PN Global ,
it would simply save the currently edited file.
.LP
If a word processor was sent a 
.PN SaveYourself
with a type of
.PN Both ,
it would first save the currently edited file.  It would then create a
temporary file with information such as the current position of the cursor
and what file is being edited.
.PN Restart\%Command
property with enough information to find the temporary file, 
and its 
.PN Discard\%Command 
with enough information to remove it.
.NE
.NT "Advice to Implementors"
If the client stores any state in a file or similar
\*Qexternal\*U storage, it must create a distinct
copy in response to each 
.PN SaveYourself 
message.
It \fImust not\fP simply refer to a previous copy, because
the SM may discard that previous saved state without

.NE
.LP
The shutdown field specifies whether the the system is being shut down.
.NT Rationale
The interaction
is different depending on whether or not shutdown is set.
If not shutting down,
then the client can save and resume normal operation. 
.NE
If shutting down,
the client must save and then must prevent interaction 
until it receives either a 
.PN Die
or a
.PN Shutdown\%Cancelled ,
because anything the user does after the save will be lost.
.LP
The fast field specifies that the client should save its state as quickly as
possible.  For example, if the SM knows that power is about to fail, it
should set the fast field to

All property values are stored in a LISTofARRAY8. If the type of the
property is CARD8, the value is stored as a LISTofARRAY8 with one ARRAY8
that is one byte long. That single byte contains the CARD8. If the type of
the property is ARRAY8, the value is stored in the first element of a single
element LISTofARRAY8.

.IP CloneCommand 3
This is like the 
.PN RestartCommand 
except it restarts a copy of the
application.  The only difference is that the application doesn't
supply its client id at register time.  On POSIX systems the type
should be a LISTofARRAY8.
.IP CurrentDirectory 3
On POSIX-based systems specifies the value of the current directory that
needs to be set up prior to starting the Program and should be of type
ARRAY8.
.IP DiscardCommand 3
The discard command contains a string that when delivered to the host that 
the client is running on (determined from the connection), will
cause it to discard any information about the current state.  If this command
is not specified, the SM will assume that all of the clients state is encoded
in the 
.PN Restart\%Command .
On POSIX systems the type should be LISTofARRAY8.
.IP Environment 3
On POSIX based systems, this will be of type LISTofARRAY8 where
the ARRAY8s alternate between environment variable name and environment
variable value.  
.IP ProcessID 3
This specifies an OS specific identifier for the process.  On POSIX
systems this should of type ARRAY8 and contain the return value 
of getpid() turned into an ISO 8859-1 (decimal) string.
.IP Program 3
The name of the program that is running.  On POSIX systems this 
should be the
first parameter passed to execve and should be of type ARRAY8.
.IP RestartCommand 3
The restart command contains a string that when delivered to the
host that the client is running on (determined from the connection),
will cause the client to restart in
its current state.  On POSIX-based systems this is of type LISTofARRAY8
and each of the elements in the array represents an element in
the argv array.
This restart command should ensure that the client restarts with the specified
client-ID.
.IP ResignCommand 3
A client that sets the
.PN RestartStyleHint
to
.PN RestartAnway
uses this property to specify command 
that undoes the effect of the client and removes
any saved state.
.NT Example
A user runs xmodmap. xmodmap registers with the SM, sets 
.PN Restart\%Style\%Hint
to 
.PN Restart\%Anyway ,
and then terminates. In order to allow the SM (at the
user's request) to undo this, xmodmap would register a
.PN Resign\%Command
that undoes the effects of the xmodmap.
.NE
.IP RestartStyleHint 3
.RS
.LP
If the RestartStyleHint property is present, it will contain the 
style of restarting the client prefers.  If this flag isn't specified,
.PN RestartIfRunning
is assumed.
The possible values are as follows:

.sp 6p
_
.TE
.LP
The
.PN RestartIfRunning
style is used in the usual case.  The client should
be restarted in the next session if it was running at the end of the
current session.
.LP
The
.PN RestartAnyway
style is used to tell the SM that the application
should be restarted in the next session even if it exits before the 
current session is terminated.  
It should be noted that this is only a hint and the SM
will follow the policies specified by its users in determining what applications
to restart.
.LP
.NT Rationale
This can be specified by a client which supports (as Windows clients
do) a means for the user to indicate while exiting that
restarting is desired.  It can also be used for clients that
spawn other clients and then go away, but which want to be
restarted.
.NE
.LP
A client that uses
.PN RestartAnyway
should also set the
.PN ResignCommand
and
.PN ShutdownCommand
properties to commands that undo the state of the client
after it exits.
.LP
The
.PN RestartImmediately
style is like
.PN RestartAnyway ,
but in addition, the
client is meant to run continuously.  If the client exits, the
SM should try to restart it in the current session.
.NT "Advice to Implementors"
It would be wise to sanity-check the frequency which which
.PN RestartImmediately
clients are restarted, to avoid a sick
client being restarted continuously.
.NE
.RE
.IP ShutdownCommand
This command is executed at shutdown time to clean up after a client that
is no longer running but retained its state by setting
.PN RestartStyleHint
to 
.PN RestartAnyway .
The command must not remove any saved state as the client is still part of
the session.
.NT Example
A client is run at start up time that turns on a camera. This client then
exits. At session shutdown, the user wants the camera turned off. This client
would set the 
.PN Restart\%Style\%Hint
to 
.PN Restart\%Anyway
and would register a 
.PN Shutdown\%Command
that would turn off the camera.
.NE
.IP UserID 3
Specifies the user's ID.  On POSIX-based systems this
will contain the the user's name (the pw_name field of struct passwd).
